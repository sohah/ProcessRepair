This document describes how to run the expirment of daikon invariants and to check them against the original properties.

1. First you need to have your verified properties in the formate of
p1 = invairant;

the spaces and the semicolons are important, as the scripts are going to cut using index on the string.

2. add the invariants under props/daikonExperiment/daikonverified

3. run makeLustreBody.pl script to generate the body that includes the newly found daikon invariants, for example:

perl makeLustreBody.pl props/daikonExperiment/daikonverified/verifiedProps_wbs wbs > props/daikonExperiment/Body/verifiedProp_wbs.lus

runs the perl script on the verified properties of wbs and populates the output inside the Body folder. Note that the Body folder needs to exists under daikonExperiment

4.make sure you turned on/off mac flag in originalproptest.java
